# Remote Self-Destruct USB Device

## Project Overview
This project is focused on creating a **remote self-destruct USB device**. The concept is to have a USB device that can be remotely triggered to self-destruct (or wipe data) upon being plugged into any device. The self-destruct mechanism can vary depending on user preferences, such as:
- Wiping all data from the USB device.
- Disabling or damaging the host device it's plugged into.
- A combination of both.

The remote self-destruct feature can be activated through a different laptop, mobile device, or other system connected to the internet or via direct communication with the USB device.

## Features
- **Remote Activation**: Trigger the self-destruct sequence remotely via an internet connection.
- **Flexible Destruction Options**: Choose whether to wipe data on the USB, disable the host device, or both.
- **Security and Authentication**: Secure communication between the remote device and the USB to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Data Wiping**: Implement secure data wiping techniques to ensure all sensitive data is erased.
- **Physical Destruction (optional)**: Future plans to include a physical destruction option for the USB or host device.

## Installation

### Requirements:
- A microcontroller-based USB (e.g., Raspberry Pi Zero, ESP32, Arduino).
- A server or backend to handle remote communication.
- A host computer with Python or other compatible software to run the self-destruct scripts.

### Steps:
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/remote-self-destruct-usb.git
    cd remote-self-destruct-usb
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Set up the backend server (e.g., using Flask or Node.js) to handle remote commands.

4. Flash the microcontroller with the firmware to handle USB activation and destruction.

5. Configure the communication system between the remote device and USB.

## Usage

1. Plug the USB device into a host computer.
2. Send a self-destruct command from a remote device (laptop, mobile phone, etc.) via the backend server.
3. The USB device will initiate the self-destruct sequence, including data wiping or disabling the host system.
